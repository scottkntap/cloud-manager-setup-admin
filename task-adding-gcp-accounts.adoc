You can manage two types of Google Cloud Platform credentials from Cloud Manager: the credentials that are associated with the Connector VM instance and storage access keys used with a Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.6 system for link:concept-data-tiering.html[data tiering].

== Associating a Marketplace subscription with GCP credentials

When you deploy a Connector in GCP, Cloud Manager creates a default set of credentials that are associated with the Connector VM instance. These are the credentials that Cloud Manager uses to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

At any time, you can change the Marketplace subscription that's associated with these credentials. The subscription enables you to create a pay-as-you-go Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, and to use other NetApp cloud services.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the Cloud Manager console, click the Settings icon, and select *Credentials*.

. Click the action menu for a set of credentials and then select *Associate Subscription*.

. Select a Google Cloud project and subscription from the down-down list.
+
image:screenshot_gcp_associate.gif[A screenshot of a Google Cloud project and subscription selected for Google Cloud credentials.]

. Click *Associate*.

. If you don't already have a subscription, click *Add Subscription* and follow the steps to create a new subscription below.
+
NOTE: Before you complete the following steps, ensure that you have both Billing Admin privileges in your Google Cloud account as well as a NetApp Cloud Central login.

. Reivew the subscription steps and click *Continue*.
+

. After you're redirected to the https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/netapp-cloudmanager/cloud-manager[NetApp Cloud Manager page on the Google Cloud Marketplace^], ensure that the correct project is selected at the top navigation menu.
+

. Click *Subscribe*.

. Select the appropriate billing account and agree to the terms and conditions.
+

. Click *Subscribe*.
+
This step sends your transfer request to NetApp.

. On the pop-up dialog box, click *Register with NetApp, Inc.* to be redirected to NetApp Cloud Central.
+

+
NOTE: This step must be completed to link the GCP subscription to your NetApp account. The process of linking a subscription isn't complete until you are redirected from this page and then sign in to NetApp Cloud Central.

. After you're redirected to Cloud Central, log in to NetApp Cloud Central or sign up, and then click *Done* to proceed.
+
The GCP subscription will be linked to all NetApp accounts that your user login is associated with.
+

+
NOTE: If someone from your organization has already subscribed to the NetApp Cloud Manager subscription from your billing account, then you will be redirected to https://cloud.netapp.com/ontap-cloud?x-gcp-marketplace-token=[the Cloud Volumes ONTAP page on NetApp Cloud Central^] instead. If this is unexpected, contact your NetApp sales team. Google enables only one subscription per Google billing account.

. Once this process is complete, navigate back to the Credentials page in Cloud Manager and select this new subscription.

=== Troubleshooting the Marketplace subscription process

Sometimes subscribing to Cloud Volumes ONTAP through the Google Cloud Marketplace can become fragmented due to incorrect permissions or accidentally not following the redirection to NetApp Cloud Central. If this happens, use the following steps to complete the subscription process.

.Steps

. Navigate to the https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/netapp-cloudmanager/cloud-manager[NetApp Cloud Manager page on the Google Cloud Marketplace^] to check on the state of the order. If the page states *Manage on Provider*, scroll down and click *Manage Orders*.
+
image:screenshot_gcp_manage_orders.png[A screenshot of the marketplace page post subscription.]

.. If the order shows a green check mark and this is unexpected, somebody else from the organization using the same billing account might already be subscribed. If this is unexpected or you require the details of this subscription, contact your NetApp sales team.
+

.. If the order shows a clock and *Pending* status, go back to the marketplace page and choose *Manage on Provider* to complete the process as documented above.

== Setting up and adding GCP accounts for data tiering with Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.6

If you want to enable a Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.6 system for link:concept-data-tiering.html[data tiering], you need to provide Cloud Manager with a storage access key for a service account that has Storage Admin permissions. Cloud Manager uses the access keys to set up and manage a Cloud Storage bucket for data tiering.

TIP: If you want to use data tiering with Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.7 or later, then follow step 4 in link:task-getting-started-gcp.html[Getting started with Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Google Cloud Platform].

=== Setting up a service account and access keys for Google Cloud Storage

A service account enables Cloud Manager to authenticate and access Cloud Storage buckets used for data tiering. The keys are required so that Google Cloud Storage knows who is making the request.

.Steps

. Open the GCP IAM console and https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles#creating_a_custom_role[create a service account that has the Storage Admin role^].
+
image:screenshot_gcp_service_account_role.gif[A screenshot of the GCP IAM console that shows the selection of the Storage Admin role for a service account.]

. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/settings[GCP Storage Settings^].

. If you're prompted, select a project.

. Click the *Interoperability* tab.

. If you haven't already done so, click *Enable interoperability access*.

. Under *Access keys for service accounts*, click *Create a key for a service account*.

. Select the service account that you created in step 1.
+
image:screenshot_gcp_access_key.gif[A screenshot of the GCP storage console that shows a selected service account for a new access key.]

. Click *Create Key*.

. Copy the access key and secret.
+
You'll need to enter this information in Cloud Manager when you add the GCP account for data tiering.

=== Adding a GCP account to Cloud Manager

Now that you have an access key for a service account, you can add it to Cloud Manager.

.What you'll need

You need to create a Connector before you can change Cloud Manager settings. link:concept-connectors.html#how-to-create-a-connector[Learn how].

.Steps

. In the upper right of the Cloud Manager console, click the Settings icon, and select *Credentials*.
+
image:screenshot_settings_icon.gif[A screenshot that shows the Settings icon in the upper right of the Cloud Manager console.]

. Click *Add Credentials* and select *Google Cloud*.

. Enter the access key and secret for the service account.
+
The keys enable Cloud Manager to set up a Cloud Storage bucket for data tiering.

. Confirm that the policy requirements have been met and then click *Create Account*.

.What's next?

You can now enable data tiering on individual volumes on a Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.6 system when you create, modify, or replicate them. For details, see link:task-tiering.html[Tiering inactive data to low-cost object storage].

But before you do, be sure that the subnet in which Cloud Volumes ONTAP resides is configured for Private Google Access. For instructions, refer to https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access[Google Cloud Documentation: Configuring Private Google Access^].
