You can monitor the status of the operations that BlueXP is performing to see if there are any issues that you need to address. You can view the status in the Notification Center, in the Timeline, or have notifications sent to your email.

The following table provides a comparison of the Notification Center and the Timeline so you can understand what each has to offer.

== Monitor activities using the Notification Center

Notifications track the progress of operations that you've initiated in BlueXP so you can verify whether the operation was successful or not. They enable you to view the status for many BlueXP actions that you initiated during your current login session. Not all services report information into the Notification Center at this time.
// Notifications can even prompt you to retry a failed operation.

You can display the notifications by clicking the notification bell (image:icon_bell.png[notification bell]) in the menu bar. The color of the little bubble in the bell indicates the highest level severity notification that is active. So if you see a red bubble, it means there's an important notification that you should look at.

You can also configure BlueXP to send notifications by email so you can be informed of important system activity even when you're not logged into the system. Emails can be sent to any users who are part of your BlueXP account, or to any other recipients who need to be aware of certain types of system activity. See <<Setting email notification settings,Setting email notification settings>> below.

=== Notification types

Notifications are classified in the following categories:

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="22,58",width="85%"]
|===

| Notification type
| Description

| Critical | A problem occurred that might lead to service disruption if corrective action is not taken immediately.
| Error | An action or process ended with failure, or could lead to failure if corrective action is not taken.
| Warning  | An issue that you should be aware of to make sure it does not reach the critical severity. Notifications of this severity do not cause service disruption, and immediate corrective action might not be required.
| Recommendation | A system recommendation for you to take an action to improve the system or a certain service; for example: costs saving, suggestion for new services, recommended security configuration, etc.
| Information | A message that provides additional information about an action or process.
| Success | An action or process completed successfully.

=== Filter notifications

By default you'll see all notifications. You can filter the notifications that you see in the Notification Center to show only those notifications that are important to you. You can filter by BlueXP "Service" and by notification "Type".

For example, if you want to see only "Error" and "Warning" notifications for BlueXP operations, select those entries and you'll see only those types of notifications.

// === Selecting which account and which user notifications you will see
//
// By default, you'll see only your notification in the current account. You can choose to view notifications for the current account or all accounts, and you can choose to view notifications for your actions or all user actions.
//
// .Steps
//
// . In the Notification Center, click image:button_3_vert_dots.png[] and select *Settings*.
//
// image:screenshot_notification_settings.png[A screenshot of the available settings for the Notification Center.]
//
// . Choose from the following options:
//
// * Show notifications for the current account or for all accounts.
// * Show notifications for just your user login, or for all users in the account.

=== Set email notification settings

You can send specific types of notifications by email so you can be informed of important system activity even when you're not logged into BlueXP. Emails can be sent to any users who are part of your BlueXP account, or to any other recipients who need to be aware of certain types of system activity.

[NOTE]
====
* At this time, notifications are sent by email for the following BlueXP features and services: Connectors, Cloud Sync, Cloud Backup, and Ransomware Protection. Additional services will be added in future releases.
* Sending email notifications is not supported when the Connector is installed in a site without internet access.
====

By default, BlueXP Account Admins will receive emails for all "Critical" and "Recommendation" notifications. All other users and recipients are configured, by default, not to receive any notification emails.

You must be an Account Admin to customize the notifications settings.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP menu bar, select *Settings > Alerts and Notifications Settings*.
+

. Select a user, or multiple users, from either the _Account Users_ tab or the _Additional Recipients_ tab, and choose the type of notifications to be sent:

* To make changes for a single user, select the menu in the Notifications column for that user, check the types of Notifications to be sent, and select *Apply*.
* To make changes for multiple users, check the box for each user, select *Manage Email Notifications*, check the types of Notifications to be sent, and select *Apply*.

=== Add additional email recipients

The users who appear in the _Account Users_ tab are populated automatically from the users in your BlueXP account (from the link:task-managing-netapp-accounts.html#creating-and-managing-users[Manage Account page]). You can add email addresses in the _Additional Recipients_ tab for other people, or groups, who do not have access to BlueXP, but who need to be notified about certain types of alerts and notifications.

.Steps

. From the Alerts and Notifications Settings page, select *Add New Recipients*.
+
image:screenshot-add-email-recipient.png[A screenshot showing how to add new email recipients for alerts and notifications.]

. Enter the name, email address, and select the types of Notifications that recipient will receive, and select *Add New Recipient*.

=== Dismiss notifications

You can remove notifications from the page if you no longer need to see them. You can dismiss all notifications at once, or you can dismiss individual notifications.

To dismiss all notifications, in the Notification Center, select image:button_3_vert_dots.png[an icon with three vertical dots] and select *Dismiss All*.

To dismiss individual notifications, hover your cursor over the notification and select *Dismiss*.

== Audit user activity in your account

The Timeline in BlueXP shows the actions that users completed to manage your account. This includes management actions such as associating users, creating workspaces, creating Connectors, and more.

Checking the Timeline can be helpful if you need to identify who performed a specific action, or if you need to identify the status of an action.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP menu bar, select *Settings > Timeline*.

. Under the Filters, select *Service*, enable *Tenancy*, and select *Apply*.

.Result

The Timeline updates to show you account management actions.
