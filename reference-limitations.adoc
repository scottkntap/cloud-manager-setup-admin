Known limitations identify platforms, devices, or functions that are not supported by this release of the product, or that do not interoperate correctly with it. Review these limitations carefully.

== Only an HTTP proxy server is supported

If your corporate policies require you to use a proxy server for all HTTP communication to the internet, then you must configure your Connectors to use that HTTP proxy server. The proxy server can be in the cloud or in your network.

Cloud Manager doesn't support using an HTTPS proxy with the Connector.

== SSL decryption isn't supported

Cloud Manager doesn't support firewall configurations that have SSL decryption enabled. If SSL decryption is enabled, error messages appear in Cloud Manager and the Connector instance displays as inactive.

For enhanced security, you have the option to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_installing_https_cert.html[install an HTTPS certificate signed by a certificate authority (CA)].

== Blank page when loading the local UI

If you load the local user interface for a Connector, the UI might fail to display sometimes, and you just get a blank page.

This issue is related to a caching problem. The workaround is to use an incognito or private web browser session.

== Pay-as-you-go not available for Azure and Google Cloud partners

If you are a Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partner or a Google Cloud partner, NetApp pay-as-you-go subscriptions are not available. You must purchase a license and deploy NetApp cloud solutions with a BYOL license.

Pay-as-you-go subscriptions are not available for the following NetApp cloud services:

*	Cloud Volumes ONTAP
*	Cloud Tiering
*	Cloud Backup
*	Cloud Data Sense

== Only one HA pair in an Azure resource group

You must use a dedicated resource group for each Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pair that you deploy in Azure. Only one HA pair is supported in a resource group.

Cloud Manager experiences connection issues if you try to deploy a second Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pair in an Azure resource group.

== Connectors should remain running

A Connector should remain running at all times. It's important for the continued health and operation of the services that you enable.

For example, a Connector is a key component in the health and operation of Cloud Volumes ONTAP PAYGO systems. If a Connector is powered down, Cloud Volumes ONTAP PAYGO systems will shut down after losing communication with a Connector for longer than 14 days.

== SaaS platform is disabled for Government regions

If you deploy a Connector in an AWS GovCloud region, an Azure Gov region, or an Azure DoD region, access to Cloud Manager is available only through a Connector's host IP address. Access to the SaaS platform is disabled for the entire account.

This means that only privileged users who can access the end-user internal VPC/VNet can use Cloud Manager's UI or API.

It also means that the following services aren't available from Cloud Manager:

* Cloud Data Sense
* Kubernetes
* Cloud Tiering
* Global File Cache

The SaaS platform is required to use these services.

NOTE: Cloud Backup, Cloud Data Sense, and the Monitoring service are supported and available in Government regions.

== Cloud Manager doesn't support downgrades of Cloud Volumes ONTAP

Cloud Manager doesn't support downgrading Cloud Volumes ONTAP to a previous version. Contact NetApp technical support for help with downgrades.

== Shared Linux hosts are not supported

The Connector isn't supported on a host that is shared with other applications. The host must be a dedicated host.

== Cloud Manager doesn't support FlexGroup volumes

While Cloud Volumes ONTAP supports FlexGroup volumes, Cloud Manager does not. If you create a FlexGroup volume from System Manager or from the CLI, then you should set Cloud Manager's Capacity Management mode to Manual. Automatic mode might not work properly with FlexGroup volumes.

== Cloud Manager doesn't support ONTAP S3

While Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure supports objects using S3, Cloud Manager doesn't provide any management capabilities for this feature. Using the CLI is the best practice to configure S3 client access from Cloud Volumes ONTAP. For details, refer to the http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.pow-s3-cg/home.html[S3 Configuration Power Guide^].
