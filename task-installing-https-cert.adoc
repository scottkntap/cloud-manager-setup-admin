By default, BlueXP uses a self-signed certificate for HTTPS access to the web console. You can install a certificate signed by a certificate authority (CA), which provides better security protection than a self-signed certificate.

+
Details about the BlueXP certificate displays, including the expiration date.

. Select *Change Certificate* and follow the steps to generate a CSR or install your own CA-signed certificate.
