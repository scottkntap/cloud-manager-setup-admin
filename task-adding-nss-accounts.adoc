Adding your NetApp Support Site account to BlueXP is required to enable the following tasks:

* To deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP when you bring your own license (BYOL)
+
Providing your NSS account is required so that BlueXP can upload your license key and to enable the subscription for the term that you purchased. This includes automatic updates for term renewals.

* To register pay-as-you-go Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems
+
Providing your NSS account is required to activate support for your system and to gain access to NetApp technical support resources.

* To upgrade Cloud Volumes ONTAP software to the latest release

* To use Active IQ Digital Advisor from within BlueXP

== Add an NSS account

The Support Dashboard enables you to add and manage your NetApp Support Site accounts for use with BlueXP.

*	If you have a customer-level account, you can add one or more NSS accounts.

*	If you have a partner or reseller account, you can add one or more NSS accounts, but they can’t be added alongside customer-level accounts.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, click the Help icon, and select *Support*.

These actions enable BlueXP to use your NSS account for things like license downloads, software upgrade verification, and future support registrations.
+
Note the following:
+
*	The account must be a customer-level account (not a guest or temp account).

*	Upon successful login, NetApp will store the NSS user name. This is a system generated ID that maps to your email. On the *NSS Management* page, you can display your email from the image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/cloud-manager-family/main/media/icon-nss-menu.png[An icon of three horizontal dots] menu.

*	If you ever need to refresh your login credential tokens, there is also an *Update Credentials* option in the image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/cloud-manager-family/main/media/icon-nss-menu.png[An icon of three horizontal dots] menu.
