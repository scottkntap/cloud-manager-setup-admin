Depending on the actions that you've taken in BlueXP, you might have associated ONTAP credentials and NetApp Support Site (NSS) credentials with your BlueXP user login. You can view and manage those credentials in BlueXP after you've associated them. For example, if you change the password for these credentials, then you'll need to update the password in BlueXP.

== ONTAP credentials

When you directly discover an on-premises ONTAP cluster without using a Connector, you're prompted to enter ONTAP credentials for the cluster. These credentials are managed at the user level, which means they aren't viewable by other users who log in.

== NSS credentials

The NSS credentials associated with your BlueXP login enables access to Digital Advisor and case management capabilities.

* When you access Digital Advisor in BlueXP, you're prompted to log in to Digital Advisor by entering your NSS credentials.

* When you access *Support > Case Management*, you're prompted to enter your NSS credentials, if you haven't already done so. This page enables you to manage the support cases associated with your NSS account and with your company.

Note the following about the NSS account:

* The account is managed at the user level, which means it isn't viewable by other users who log in.

* The account can't be used with any other BlueXP feature: not with Cloud Volumes ONTAP creation, licensing, or support case creation.

* There can be only one NSS account associated with Digital Advisor and case management, per user.

NetApp Support Site credentials are also associated with the BlueXP account that you are a member of. NSS account-level credentials enable you to register for support, deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP when you bring your own license (BYOL), and more.
