[.lead]
To deploy the Connector in restricted mode, you need to deploy a Connector from your cloud provider's marketplace or by manually installing the Connector software on an existing Linux host. You can then set up BlueXP by accessing the user interface that's running on the Connector.

== Install the Connector

After you verify that you have a supported Linux host, you can obtain the Connector software and then install it.

.AWS Marketplace
--

.Before you get started

The IAM user who creates the Connector must have AWS Marketplace permissions to subscribe and unsubscribe.

.Steps

. Set up permissions in AWS:

.. From the IAM console, create the required policies by copying and pasting the contents of link:reference-permissions-aws.html[the IAM policies for the Connector].

.. Create an IAM role with the role type Amazon EC2 and attach the policies that you created in the previous step to the role.

. Go to the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B018REK8QG[BlueXP page on the AWS Marketplace^] to deploy the Connector from an AMI:

. On the Marketplace page, click *Continue to Subscribe* and then click *Continue to Configuration*.
+
image:screenshot-subscribe-aws.png[A screenshot that shows the Continue to Subscribe and Continue to Configuration buttons on the AWS Marketplace.]

. Change any of the default options and click *Continue to Launch*.

. Under *Choose Action*, select *Launch through EC2* and then click *Launch*.
+
These steps describe how to launch the instance from the EC2 Console because the console enables you to attach an IAM role to the Connector instance. This isn't possible using the *Launch from Website* action.

. Follow the prompts to configure and deploy the instance:

* *Name and tags*: Enter a name and tags for the instance.

* *Application and OS Image*: Skip this section. The Connector AMI is already selected.

* *Instance type*: Depending on region availability, choose one of the supported instance types (t3.xlarge is recommended).
+
link:task-installing-linux.html[Review the instance requirements].

* *Key pair (login)*: Select the key pair that you want to use to securely connect to the instance.

* *Network settings*: Edit the network settings as needed:
+
** Choose the desired VPC and subnet.
** Specify whether the instance should have a public IP address.
** Specify firewall settings that enable the required connection methods for the Connector instance: SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.

* *Configure storage*: Keep the default storage options.

* *Advanced details*: Under *IAM instance profile*, choose the IAM role that you created in step 1.

* *Summary*: Review the summary and click *Launch instance*.
+
AWS launches the software with the specified settings. The Connector instance and software should be running in approximately five minutes.

. Open a web browser from a host that has a connection to the Connector instance and enter the following URL:
+
https://_ipaddress_

. After you log in, set up the Connector:
.. Specify the NetApp account to associate with the Connector.
+
link:concept-netapp-accounts.html[Learn about NetApp accounts].
.. Enter a name for the system.

. Open a web browser and go to https://console.bluexp.netapp.com to start using the Connector with BlueXP.

.Result

The Connector is now installed and set up with your NetApp account. BlueXP will automatically use this Connector when you create new working environments. But if you have more than one Connector, you'll need to link:task-managing-connectors.html[switch between them].

If you have Amazon S3 buckets in the same AWS account where you created the Connector, you'll see an Amazon S3 working environment appear on the Canvas automatically. link:task-viewing-amazon-s3.html[Learn more about what you can do with this working environment].
--

.AWS Gov Marketplace
--
To deploy the Connector in an AWS Government region, you need to go to the EC2 service and select the BlueXP offering from the AWS Marketplace.

.Steps

. Set up permissions in AWS:

.. From the IAM console, create your own policy by copying and pasting the contents of link:reference-permissions-aws.html[the IAM policy for the Connector].

.. Create an IAM role with the role type Amazon EC2 and attach the policy that you created in the previous step to the role.

. Go to the BlueXP offering in the AWS Marketplace.
+
The IAM user must have AWS Marketplace permissions to subscribe and unsubscribe.

.. Open the EC2 service and select *Launch instance*.
.. Select *AWS Marketplace*.
.. Search for BlueXP and select the offering.
+
image:screenshot-gov-cloud-mktp.png[A screenshot that shows the BlueXP offering after searching for it in the AWS Marketplace]

.. Click *Continue*.

. Follow the prompts to configure and deploy the instance:

* *Choose an Instance Type*: Depending on region availability, choose one of the supported instance types (t3.xlarge is recommended).
+
link:task-installing-linux.html[Review the instance requirements].

* *Configure Instance Details*: Select a VPC and subnet, choose the IAM role that you created in step 1, enable termination protection (recommended), and choose any other configuration options that meet your requirements.
+
image:screenshot_aws_iam_role.gif[A screenshot that shows fields on the Configure Instance page in AWS. The IAM role that you should have created in step 1 is selected.]

* *Add Storage*: Keep the default storage options.

* *Add Tags*: Enter tags for the instance, if desired.

* *Configure Security Group*: Specify the required connection methods for the Connector instance: SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.

* *Review*: Review your selections and click *Launch*.

.Result

AWS launches the software with the specified settings. The Connector instance and software should be running in approximately five minutes.

.Azure Marketplace
--
.Steps

. Go to the NetApp Connector VM page in the Azure Marketplace.
+
* https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/netapp.netapp-oncommand-cloud-manager[Azure Marketplace page for commercial regions^]
* https://portal.azure.us/#create/netapp.netapp-oncommand-cloud-manageroccm-byol[Azure Marketplace page for Azure Government regions^]

. Click *Get it now* and then click *Continue*.

. From the Azure portal, click *Create* and follow the steps to configure the virtual machine.
+
Note the following as you configure the VM:

* The Connector can perform optimally with either HDD or SSD disks.

* Choose a VM size that meets CPU and RAM requirements. We recommend DS3 v2.

* For the network security group, the Connector requires inbound connections using SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.
+
link:reference-ports-azure.html[Learn more about security group rules for the Connector].

* Under *Management*, enable *System assigned managed identity* for the Connector by selecting *On*.
+
This setting is important because a managed identity allows the Connector virtual machine to identify itself to Azure Active Directory without providing any credentials. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview[Learn more about managed identities for Azure resources^].

. On the *Review + create* page, review your selections and click *Create* to start the deployment.
+
Azure deploys the virtual machine with the specified settings. The virtual machine and Connector software should be running in approximately five minutes.

. Provide permissions.
--

.Manual install
--
.What you'll need

* Root privileges to install the Connector.

* Details about a proxy server, if a proxy is required for internet access from the Connector.
+
You have the option to configure a proxy server after installation but doing so requires restarting the Connector.

* A CA-signed certificate, if the proxy server uses HTTPS.

.About this task

* The installation installs the AWS command line tools (awscli) to enable recovery procedures from NetApp support.
+
If you receive a message that installing the awscli failed, you can safely ignore the message. The Connector can operate successfully without the tools.

* The installer that is available on the NetApp Support Site might be an earlier version. After installation, the Connector automatically updates itself if a new version is available.

.Steps

. Verify that docker is enabled and running.
+
[source,cli]
sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo systemctl start docker

. Download the Connector software from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/cloud-manager/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^], and then copy it to the Linux host.
+
You should download the "online" Connector installer that's meant for use in your network or in the cloud. A separate "offline" installer is available for the Connector, but it's only supported with private mode deployments.

. Assign permissions to run the script.
+
[source,cli]
chmod +x OnCommandCloudManager-V3.9.23

. Run the installation script.
+
[source,cli]
 ./OnCommandCloudManager-V3.9.23 --proxy <HTTP or HTTPS proxy server> --cacert <path and file name of a CA-signed certificate>
+
The --proxy and --cacert parameters are optional. If you have a proxy server, you will need to enter the parameter(s) as shown. The installer doesn't prompt you to provide information about a proxy.
+
Here's an example of the command using both optional parameters:
+
[source,cli]
 ./OnCommandCloudManager-V3.9.23 --proxy https://user:password@10.0.0.30:8080/ --cacert /tmp/cacert/certificate.cer
+
--proxy configures the Connector to use an HTTP or HTTPS proxy server using one of the following formats:
+
* \http://address:port
* \http://username:password@address:port
* \https://address:port
* \https://username:password@address:port

+
--cacert specifies a CA-signed certificate to use for HTTPS access between the Connector and the proxy server. This parameter is required only if you specify an HTTPS proxy server.
+
The Connector is now installed. At the end of the installation, the Connector service (occm) restarts twice if you specified a proxy server.

. Provide permissions.
