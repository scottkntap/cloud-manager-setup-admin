A _BlueXP account_ provides multi-tenancy and enables you to organize users and resources in isolated workspaces from within BlueXP. For example, multiple users can deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in isolated environments called _workspaces_. These workspaces are invisible to other users, unless they are shared.

When you first access BlueXP, you're prompted to select or create an account. For example, you'll see the following screen if you don't have an account yet:

BlueXP Account Admins can then modify the settings for this account by managing users (members), workspaces, and Connectors:

== Deployment modes

BlueXP offers the following deployment modes for your account: standard mode, restricted mode, and private mode. These modes support environments that have distinct requirements for data security and privacy.

== Members

Members are BlueXP users that you associate with your BlueXP account. Associating a user with an account and one or more workspaces in that account enables those users to create and manage working environments in BlueXP.

When you associate a user, you assign them a role:

* _Account Admin_: Can perform any action in BlueXP.
* _Workspace Admin_: Can create and manage resources in the assigned workspace.
* _Compliance Viewer_: Can only view Cloud Data Sense compliance information and generate reports for systems that they have permission to access.
* _SnapCenter Admin_: Can use the SnapCenter Service to create application consistent backups and restore data using those backups. _This service is currently in Beta._

== Workspaces

In BlueXP, a workspace isolates any number of _working environments_ from other working environments. Workspace Admins can't access the working environments in a workspace unless the Account Admin associates the admin with that workspace.

A working environment represents a storage system. For example:

* A Cloud Volumes ONTAP system
* An on-premises ONTAP cluster
* A Kubernetes cluster

== Connectors

A Connector enables BlueXP to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. The Connector runs on a virtual machine instance that you deploy in your cloud provider, or on an on-prem host that you configured.

You can use a Connector with more than one BlueXP service. For example, if you're using a Connector to manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you can use that same Connector with another service like Cloud Tiering.

== Examples

The following examples depict how you might set up your accounts.

NOTE: In both example images that follow, the Connector and the Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems don't actually reside _in_ the BlueXP account--they're running in a cloud provider. This is a conceptual representation of the relationship between each component.

=== Multiple workspaces

The following example shows an account that uses two workspaces to create isolated environments. The first workspace is for a production environment and the second is for a dev environment.

=== Multiple accounts

Here's another example that shows the highest level of multi-tenancy by using two separate BlueXP accounts. For example, a service provider might use BlueXP in one account to provide services for their customers, while using another account to provide disaster recovery for one of their business units.

Note that account 2 includes two separate Connectors. This might happen if you have systems in separate regions or in separate cloud providers.
