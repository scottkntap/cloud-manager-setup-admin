Set up Google Cloud permissions so that you can use BlueXP to manage your data and storage infrastructure in Google Cloud

You need to set up Google Cloud permissions as follows:

* If you are planning to create the Connector from BlueXP or by using gcloud, then you need to set up permissions for the Google Cloud user who will deploy the Connector VM.

* Set up permissions for the Connector by creating a role and granting the role to a service account.
+
You'll associate this service account with the Connector VM so that BlueXP has the required permissions. 

Depending on your configuration, you might need to complete the following steps as well:

* Set up permissions across projects
* Set up permissions for a shared VPC

== Set up permissions to create the Connector from BlueXP or gcloud

Before you can deploy a Connector from BlueXP or by using gcloud, you need to ensure that your Google Cloud account has the correct permissions.

.Steps

. Create a custom role in Google Cloud:

.. Create a YAML file that includes the following permissions:
+
[source,yaml]
title: Connector deployment policy
description: Permissions for the user who deploys the Connector from BlueXP
stage: GA
includedPermissions:
- compute.disks.create
- compute.disks.get
- compute.disks.list
- compute.disks.setLabels
- compute.disks.use
- compute.firewalls.create
- compute.firewalls.delete
- compute.firewalls.get
- compute.firewalls.list
- compute.globalOperations.get
- compute.images.get
- compute.images.getFromFamily
- compute.images.list
- compute.images.useReadOnly
- compute.instances.attachDisk
- compute.instances.create
- compute.instances.get
- compute.instances.list
- compute.instances.setDeletionProtection
- compute.instances.setLabels
- compute.instances.setMachineType
- compute.instances.setMetadata
- compute.instances.setTags
- compute.instances.start
- compute.instances.updateDisplayDevice
- compute.machineTypes.get
- compute.networks.get
- compute.networks.list
- compute.networks.updatePolicy
- compute.projects.get
- compute.regions.get
- compute.regions.list
- compute.subnetworks.get
- compute.subnetworks.list
- compute.zoneOperations.get
- compute.zones.get
- compute.zones.list
- deploymentmanager.compositeTypes.get
- deploymentmanager.compositeTypes.list
- deploymentmanager.deployments.create
- deploymentmanager.deployments.delete
- deploymentmanager.deployments.get
- deploymentmanager.deployments.list
- deploymentmanager.manifests.get
- deploymentmanager.manifests.list
- deploymentmanager.operations.get
- deploymentmanager.operations.list
- deploymentmanager.resources.get
- deploymentmanager.resources.list
- deploymentmanager.typeProviders.get
- deploymentmanager.typeProviders.list
- deploymentmanager.types.get
- deploymentmanager.types.list
- resourcemanager.projects.get
- compute.instances.setServiceAccount
- iam.serviceAccounts.list

.. From Google Cloud, activate cloud shell.

.. Upload the YAML file that includes the required permissions.

.. Create a custom role by using the `gcloud iam roles create` command.
+
The following example creates a role named "connectorDeployment" at the project level:
+
gcloud iam roles create connectorDeployment --project=myproject --file=connector-deployment.yaml
+
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles#iam-custom-roles-create-gcloud[Google Cloud docs: Creating and managing custom roles^]

. Assign this custom role to the user who will deploy the Connector from BlueXP or by using gcloud.
+
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#grant-single-role[Google Cloud docs: Grant a single role^]

.Result

The Google Cloud user now has the permissions required to create the Connector.

== Set up permissions for the Connector

A service account is required to provide the Connector with the permissions that BlueXP needs to manage resources in Google Cloud. You need to associate this service account with the Connector VM.

.Steps

. Create a custom role in Google Cloud:

.. Create a YAML file that includes the contents of the link:reference-permissions-gcp.html[service account permissions for the Connector].

.. From Google Cloud, activate cloud shell.

.. Upload the YAML file that includes the required permissions.

.. Create a custom role by using the `gcloud iam roles create` command.
+
The following example creates a role named "connector" at the project level:
+
gcloud iam roles create connector --project=myproject --file=connector.yaml
+
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles#iam-custom-roles-create-gcloud[Google Cloud docs: Creating and managing custom roles^]

. Create a service account in Google Cloud:

.. From the IAM & Admin service, click *Service Accounts > Create Service Account*.

.. Enter service account details and click *Create and Continue*.

.. Select the role that you just created.

.. Finish the remaining steps to create the role.
+
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating_a_service_account[Google Cloud docs: Creating a service account^]

.Result

The service account for the Connector VM is set up.

== Set up permissions across projects

If you plan to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in different projects than the project where the Connector resides, then you'll need to provide the Connector's service account with access to those projects.

For example, let's say the Connector is in project 1 and you want to create Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in project 2. You'll need to grant access to the service account in project 2.

.Steps

. In the Google Cloud console, go to the IAM service and select the project where you want to create Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

. On the *IAM* page, select *Grant Access* and provide the required details.
+
* Enter the email of the Connector's service account.
* Select the Connector's custom role.
* Click *Save*.

For more details, refer to https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#grant-single-role[Google Cloud documentation^]

== Set up shared VPC permissions

If you are using a shared VPC to deploy resources into a service project, then you'll need to prepare your permissions. 

This table is for reference and your environment should reflect the permissions table when IAM configuration is complete.

|===

Notes:

. deploymentmanager.editor is only required at the host project if you are not passing firewall rules to the deployment and are choosing to let BlueXP create them for you. BlueXP will create a deployment in the host project which contains the VPC0 firewall rule if no rule is specified.

. firewall.create and firewall.delete are only required if you are not passing firewall rules to the deployment and are choosing to let BlueXP create them for you. These permissions reside in the BlueXP account .yaml file. If you are deploying an HA pair using a shared VPC, these permissions will be used to create the firewall rules for VPC1, 2 and 3. For all other deployments, these permissions will also be used to create rules for VPC0.

. For data tiering, the tiering service account must have the serviceAccount.user role on the service account, not just at the project level. Currently if you assign serviceAccount.user at the project level, the permissions don't show when you query the service account with getIAMPolicy.
