You should understand how BlueXP uses Azure credentials and permissions so that you can manage credentials for one or more Azure subscriptions.

== Initial Azure credentials

When you deploy a Connector from BlueXP, you need to use an Azure account or service principal that has permissions to deploy the Connector virtual machine. The required permissions are listed in the link:task-creating-connectors-azure.html[Connector deployment policy for Azure].

When BlueXP deploys the Connector virtual machine in Azure, it enables a https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview[system-assigned managed identity^] on virtual machine, creates a custom role, and assigns it to the virtual machine. The role provides BlueXP with the permissions required to manage resources and processes within that Azure subscription. link:reference-permissions-azure.html[Review how BlueXP uses the permissions].

BlueXP selects these Azure credentials by default when you create a new working environment for Cloud Volumes ONTAP:

You can deploy all of your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems using the initial Azure credentials, or you can add additional credentials.

== Additional Azure subscriptions for a managed identity

The system-assigned managed identity assigned to the Connector VM is associated with the subscription in which you launched the Connector. If you want to select a different Azure subscription, then you need to link:task-adding-azure-accounts.html#associating-additional-azure-subscriptions-with-a-managed-identity[associate the managed identity with those subscriptions].

== Additional Azure credentials

If you want to use different Azure credentials with BlueXP, then you must grant the required permissions by link:task-adding-azure-accounts.html[creating and setting up a service principal in Azure Active Directory] for each Azure account. The following image shows two additional accounts, each set up with a service principal and custom role that provides permissions:

image:diagram_permissions_multiple_azure.png["A conceptual image that shows the initial Azure account, which receives permissions through a custom role and managed identity, and two additional accounts that receive permissions through a custom role and service principal."]

You would then link:task-adding-azure-accounts.html#adding-azure-accounts-to-cloud-manager[add the account credentials to BlueXP] by providing details about the AD service principal.

For example, you can switch between credentials when creating a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment:

== What about Marketplace deployments and on-prem deployments?

The sections above describe the recommended deployment method for the Connector, which is from BlueXP. You can also deploy a Connector in Azure from the Azure Marketplace, and you can install the Connector software on your own Linux host.

If you use the Marketplace, you can provide permissions by assigning a custom role to the Connector VM and to a system-assigned managed identity, or you can use Azure AD service principal.

For on-premises deployments, you can't set up a managed identity for the Connector, but you can provide permissions by using a service principal.
