You can install the Connector on an on-premises Linux host that doesn't have internet access. You can then discover on-prem ONTAP clusters, replicate data between them, back up volumes using Cloud Backup, and scan them with Cloud Data Sense.

These installation instructions are specifically for the use case described above. link:concept-connectors.html#how-to-create-a-connector[Learn about other ways to deploy a Connector].

== Verify host requirements

The Connector software must run on a host that meets specific operating system requirements, RAM requirements, port requirements, and so on.

A dedicated host is required::
The Connector is not supported on a host that is shared with other applications. The host must be a dedicated host.

CPU:: 4 cores or 4 vCPUs

RAM:: 14 GB

Supported operating systems::
* CentOS 7.6
* CentOS 7.7
* CentOS 7.8
* CentOS 7.9
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.8
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.9
+
The Red Hat Enterprise Linux system must be registered with Red Hat Subscription Management. If it is not registered, the system cannot access repositories to update required 3rd party software during Connector installation.
+
The Connector is supported on English-language versions of these operating systems.

Hypervisor:: A bare metal or hosted hypervisor that is certified to run CentOS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux
https://access.redhat.com/certified-hypervisors[Red Hat Solution: Which hypervisors are certified to run Red Hat Enterprise Linux?^]

Disk type:: An SSD is required

Disk space in /opt:: 100 GiB of space must be available

Disk space in /var:: 20 GiB of space must be available

Docker Engine:: Docker Engine version 19 or later is required on the host before you install the Connector. https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[View installation instructions^].

== Install the Connector

After you verify that you have a supported Linux host, you can obtain the Connector software and then install it.

.Required privileges

Root privileges are required to install the Connector.

.Steps

.	Verify that docker is enabled and running.
+
[source,cli]
sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo systemctl start docker

. Download the BlueXP software from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/cloud-manager/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^].

. Copy the installer to the Linux host.

. Assign permissions to run the script.
+
[source,cli]
chmod +x /path/cloud-manager-connector-offline-v3.9.19

. Run the installation script:
+
[source,cli]
sudo /path/cloud-manager-connector-offline-v3.9.19

. Open a web browser and enter https://_ipaddress_ where _ipaddress_ is the IP address of the Linux host.
+
You should see the following screen.

+
This user account runs locally on the system. There's no connection to NetApp Cloud Central.

* *Review*: Review the details, accept the license agreement, and then click *Set Up*.

. Log in to BlueXP using the admin user that you just created.

.Result

The Connector is now installed and you can start using the BlueXP features that are available in a dark site deployment.
