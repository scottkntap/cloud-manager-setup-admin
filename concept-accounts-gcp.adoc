You should understand how BlueXP uses Google Cloud credentials and permissions so that you can manage credentials for one or more Google Cloud projects.

== Project and permissions for BlueXP

Before you can use BlueXP to manage resources in your Google Cloud project, you must first deploy a Connector. The Connector can't be running on your premises, or in a different cloud provider.

Two sets of permissions must be in place before you deploy a Connector directly from BlueXP:

. You need to deploy a Connector using a Google account that has permissions to launch the Connector VM instance from BlueXP.

. When deploying the Connector, you are prompted to select a https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts[service account^] for the VM instance. BlueXP gets permissions from the service account to create and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems on your behalf. Permissions are provided by attaching a custom role to the service account.

The following image depicts the permission requirements described in numbers 1 and 2 above:

== Project for Cloud Volumes ONTAP

Cloud Volumes ONTAP can reside in the same project as the Connector, or in a different project. To deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in a different project, you need to first add the Connector service account and role to that project.
